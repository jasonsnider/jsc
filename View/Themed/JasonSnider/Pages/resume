        <h4>Systems Architect and Fullstack LAMP Developer</h4>
        <p>
            I wear a lot of hats a MicroTrain, for a number of years I worked as the sole developer on a web based 
            ERP that was a mesh up of several open source projects. I have since migrated the entire system into a 
            custom LAMP application built on top of CakePHP. I then built a small research, marketing and 
            development team that focuses on improving internal operational efficiency, identifying and developing 
            products for new market opportunities and extending the marketability of our current core competencies.

        <h4>Systems Engineer</h4>
        <p>Active Care Network asked Lextech to develop a pilot system that would demonstrate the viability of their 
        drug infusion scheduling system. Not only did Lextech deliver a successful pilot, we also assisted with 
        creating the web based system after ACN received funding. The system now connects ACN to pharmaceutical 
        companies, care centers, and insurance companies to help patients get the medical care they need closer to 
        home.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>42Viral</h3>
        <p>An OpenSource AJAX driven CMS built on top of CakePHP and jQuery. This is being designed to provide barebones 
        functionality out of the box while remaining flexible enough to not get in the way of custom development. The goal is to 
        develop your idea and get it to market; even faster!</p>
